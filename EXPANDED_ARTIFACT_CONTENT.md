# Expanded Artifact Content - Implementation Guide

This file contains the complete expanded content for all artifacts. Due to the large size, the content will be implemented in sections.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Expand DPIA Generator Sample with full DPIA content
2. Expand Privacy Policy Sample with complete 13-section policy
3. Expand Data Mapping Tool with detailed interface
4. Expand GDPR Privacy Notice with full content
5. Expand Breach Notification Template with complete template
6. Expand DSR Manager with full interface details
7. Expand all Policy Template Library artifacts
8. Expand Compliance Assessment Suite artifacts
9. Expand Compliance Framework Templates artifacts
10. Update ProductPreviewModal.tsx to match

## Note

The full expanded content is too large to include in a single markdown file. The implementation will be done directly in the TypeScript files using search_replace operations.
