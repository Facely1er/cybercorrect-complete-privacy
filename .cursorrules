## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


Privacy Compliance Management System
Importance Score: 85/100

Core Business Logic Organization:

1. Assessment & Gap Analysis
- Compliance Gap Analyzer engine maps requirements across GDPR, CCPA, LGPD frameworks
- Calculates risk-weighted compliance scoring using priority levels
- Generates domain-specific maturity assessments based on implementation rates
- Maps data flows between processing activities

2. Impact Assessment Generation
- DPIA workflow implementation following GDPR Article 35 requirements
- Risk assessment calculations for data processing activities 
- Automated mitigation recommendation generation based on risk levels
- Maps processing activities to legal bases and controls

3. Remediation Management 
- POA&M system tracks milestone-based remediation
- Implements risk-based prioritization for findings
- Manages finding lifecycle with cost estimation and resource allocation
- Generates compliance metrics and progress tracking

4. Evidence Management
- Categorizes privacy compliance evidence across policies, procedures and assessments
- Implements evidence lifecycle management with audit trails
- Maps evidence to specific regulatory requirements
- Tracks evidence expiration and renewal needs

Key Integration Points:
- Risk scoring algorithms connect assessment results to remediation priorities
- Evidence mapping links controls to specific regulatory requirements
- Processing activity documentation flows into impact assessments
- Compliance metrics aggregate data across assessment and remediation components

The system implements a comprehensive privacy compliance framework focused on automated assessment, documentation and remediation workflows aligned with major privacy regulations.
