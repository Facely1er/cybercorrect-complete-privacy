## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: I can't access a feature that should be available in my plan**
A: Check your subscription status in Account → Subscription. If you believe there's an error, contact support.

**Q: My data isn't syncing across devices**
A: Cloud sync requires a Supabase account. Check if you're logged in and if Supabase is configured. Data is always saved locally first (Privacy by Design).

**Q: I'm not receiving email notifications**
A: Check your notification preferences in Account → Settings. Ensure email notifications are enabled and your email address is verified.

**Q: How do I export my data?**
A: Most tools have export options (PDF, Word, JSON, CSV). Look for the "Export" button in each tool.

**Q: Can I use the platform offline?**
A: Yes! All tools work with localStorage, so you can use them offline. Cloud sync requires an internet connection.
