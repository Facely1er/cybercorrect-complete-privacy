- ✅ Privacy metrics dashboard
- ✅ Auto-refresh functionality
- ✅ Manual scan button
- ✅ Risk status management

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- ✅ User-based data isolation
- ✅ No mock data - all risks from real user data
- ✅ Error handling and monitoring
- ✅ Secure database queries

## 📊 Database Schema

### Table: `cc_privacy_risk_detections`
- 20 columns for comprehensive risk tracking
- 7 indexes for performance
- 4 RLS policies for security
- Automatic timestamp triggers

## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Run Database Migration ✅
```sql
-- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: supabase/migrations/20250220000000_privacy_risk_radar.sql
```

### 2. Verify Installation ✅
- Check table exists: `cc_privacy_risk_detections`
- Verify RLS policies are active
- Confirm indexes are created
- **NEW**: Use verification utility: `privacyRiskRadarVerification.verifySetup()`

### 3. Test the Feature ✅
1. Navigate to `/toolkit/privacy-risk-radar`
2. Click "Scan Now" button
3. Verify risks are detected from your data
4. Check metrics are calculated correctly
5. **NEW**: View compliance scores in Compliance Scores tab

### 4. Integration Testing ✅
- Test with existing consent records
- Test with vendor assessments
- Test with data subject requests
- Test with DPIAs
- Test with retention policies
- **NEW**: Test compliance score integration with Gap Analyzer

## ✅ Completed Enhancements

### Compliance Scores Integration
- ✅ Created `complianceScoreService.ts` for unified score management
- ✅ Enhanced Compliance Scores tab to display actual framework scores
- ✅ Integrated with Privacy Gap Analyzer assessment results
- ✅ Added trend indicators and visual score displays
- ✅ Added navigation links to Gap Analyzer and Privacy Assessment

### Verification Utility
- ✅ Created `privacyRiskRadarVerification.ts` for setup verification
- ✅ Checks database table existence
- ✅ Verifies RLS policies
- ✅ Validates all services are functional
- ✅ Checks data source accessibility
- ✅ Provides formatted verification reports

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- All queries use indexes for optimal performance
- Parallel risk detection for faster scanning
- Efficient filtering and categorization
- Minimal database load with optimized queries

## 🔗 Integration Points

The Privacy Risk Radar integrates with:
- Privacy Gap Analyzer (compliance scores)
- DPIA Manager (incomplete assessments)
- Privacy Rights Manager (SAR deadlines)
- Vendor Risk Assessment (vendor compliance)
- Consent Management (consent violations)
- Retention Policy Generator (retention compliance)

## 📝 Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript with full type safety
- ✅ Error handling with errorMonitoring service
- ✅ Follows project coding patterns
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Consistent with existing codebase style
- ✅ Comprehensive error messages

## 🎨 UI/UX
