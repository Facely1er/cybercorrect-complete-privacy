Core Assessment Models:

1. DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) Model
- Structured in 4 main sections: Processing Activities, Risk Analysis, Controls, Documentation
- Risk scoring using weighted impact (1-5) x likelihood (1-5) matrix
- Automated threshold triggers for high-risk processing activities
- Granular scoring per privacy principle with weighted averages

2. CUI Assessment Framework
- 14 control families mapped to NIST SP 800-171
- Binary control implementation status (0/1) with weighted domain scoring
- Sectional maturity levels calculated on percentage implementation
- Risk categorization mapped to confidentiality impact levels

3. Privacy Framework Evaluation Model
- Maps to NIST Privacy Framework core functions
- Composite scoring across Identify, Govern, Control, Communicate, Protect 
- Progressive assessment gates requiring minimum section completion
- Framework-specific control mapping and inheritance

4. Scoring System Integration
- Unified scoring engine handling multiple assessment types
- Normalization of scores across frameworks (0-100 scale)
- Priority weighting based on regulatory requirements
- Gap analysis calculation comparing target vs actual scores

Relationships and Dependencies:

1. Cross-Framework Mapping
- GDPR requirements mapped to NIST controls
- CUI controls mapped to privacy framework categories  
- Common control identification across frameworks
- Unified evidence requirements tracking

2. Assessment Workflows
- Progressive unlocking based on prerequisite scores
- Dependencies between control implementations
- Automated recalculation of dependent scores
- Cross-framework impact analysis

3. Documentation Requirements
- Framework-specific evidence mapping
- Common evidence repository with classification
- Automated documentation triggers based on scores
- Compliance artifact generation rules
