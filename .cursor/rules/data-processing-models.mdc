## Core Data Models

### Processing Activities Registry
- Structured data model for GDPR Article 30 records
- Maps processing purposes, categories, legal bases
- Links to data flows and cross-border transfers
- Tracks processor and controller relationships

Key model relationships:
```typescript
ProcessingActivity {
  id: string
  purpose: ProcessingPurpose
  dataCategories: DataCategory[]
  legalBasis: LegalBasis
  crossBorderTransfers: Transfer[]
  processors: Processor[]
  retentionPeriod: RetentionRule
}
```

### Data Flow Mapping
- Models data movement between systems/entities
- Captures processing locations and transfer mechanisms
- Links to processing activities and legal bases
- Documents security measures and safeguards

### Rights Request Tracking
- Structured model for data subject requests
- Maps request types to affected processing activities
- Tracks request status, deadlines, and responses
- Links to data categories and processing purposes

### Legal Basis Register
- Central registry of legal bases for processing
- Maps bases to specific processing activities
- Tracks consent records and legitimate interests
- Documents basis assessment outcomes

### Cross-Border Transfer Records
- Documents international data transfers
- Maps transfer mechanisms and safeguards
- Links to SCCs and adequacy decisions
- Tracks transfer impact assessments
