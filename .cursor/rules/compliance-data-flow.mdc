- Evidence validation workflow with compliance requirements
- Audit trail maintenance for documentation changes

3. Documentation Generation Flow
Importance Score: 75/100

Document processing:
- Assessment results trigger policy updates
- Gap analysis findings populate POAM records
- Control implementation status maps to SSP sections
- Privacy rights requests generate response documentation

4. Compliance Data Lifecycle
Importance Score: 70/100

Data management:
- Privacy assessment data feeds into recommendations
- Evidence records link to specific control requirements
