Importance Score: 85/100

Core Scoring Components:

1. Compliance Gap Analysis Scoring
Path: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/ComplianceGapAnalyzer.tsx

Implements weighted domain scoring:
```typescript
calculateDomainScore(): Weighted control evaluation incorporating:
- Control priority levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Implementation status (0-100%)
- Domain context multipliers
- Aggregate maturity calculation
```

Urgency scoring formula:
```typescript
calculateUrgencyScore(): Risk-based prioritization using:
- Priority/status scoring matrix
- Time-to-implement estimates
- Risk exposure calculations
- Regulatory deadline factors
```

Maturity level progression:
```typescript
calculateMaturityLevel(): Progressive assessment using:
- Implementation rate thresholds
- Domain-specific minimums
- Cross-domain requirements
- Capability maturity indicators
```

2. POA&M Risk Scoring 
Path: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/PoamGenerator.tsx

Risk-weighted calculations:
- Milestone completion percentage with priority weights
- Cost estimation scaled by control priority
- Business impact assessment scores
- Dependencies tracking multipliers

3. GDPR Data Processing Risk Scores
Path: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/GdprMapper.tsx

Processing activity scoring:
- Data category sensitivity weights
- Processing purpose risk factors
- Cross-border transfer multipliers
- Special category data handling scores

Key Business Rules:
- Critical controls weighted 3x higher than low priority
- Maturity level progression requires minimum 80% in critical domains
- Risk scores factor both status and priority using 3x3 matrix
- Cost estimates use complexity-based multipliers
- Automated status determined by weighted control averages
