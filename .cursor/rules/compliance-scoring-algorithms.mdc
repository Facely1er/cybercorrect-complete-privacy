## Risk-Weighted Scoring System
Importance Score: 95/100

Located in: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/ComplianceGapAnalyzer.tsx

Core scoring components:
- Priority level weighting (Critical: 1.0, High: 0.8, Medium: 0.6, Low: 0.4)
- Implementation status multipliers (Complete: 1.0, Partial: 0.5, None: 0.0)
- Domain-specific maturity calculations based on control implementation rates
- Trend analysis for compliance improvement patterns

## Urgency Scoring
Importance Score: 85/100

Located in: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/PoamGenerator.tsx

Scoring factors:
- Risk level (weighted 40%)
- Regulatory deadline proximity (30%)
- Implementation complexity (20%)
- Resource availability (10%)
- Custom multipliers for regulatory mandates

## Domain Risk Categorization
Importance Score: 90/100

Located in: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/DpiaGenerator.tsx

Risk assessment metrics:
- Data sensitivity classification (5 levels)
- Processing volume impact scores
- Cross-border transfer risk weights
- Special category data multipliers
- Automated high-risk processing detection

## Compliance Gap Analysis
Importance Score: 88/100

Located in: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/CuiAssessment.tsx

Analysis components:
- Control implementation scoring
- Framework-specific weighting systems
- Gap severity classification
- Business impact correlation
- Remediation priority calculation
