Importance Score: 90/100

Core compliance scoring algorithms implemented across multiple framework-specific calculators:

## Risk-Weighted Control Scoring
- Priority-based scoring weights (Critical=1.0, High=0.75, Medium=0.5, Low=0.25)
- Control implementation status multipliers (Implemented=1.0, Partial=0.5, Planned=0.25, None=0)
- Domain maturity calculation based on weighted implementation rates
- Urgency scoring using priority * (1 - implementation status)

File: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/ComplianceGapAnalyzer.tsx

## Multi-Framework Gap Analysis
- Cross-framework control mapping between NIST, ISO, GDPR requirements
- Framework-specific scoring thresholds and weightings
- Gap prioritization using:
  - Business impact rating (1-5)
  - Implementation difficulty (1-3) 
  - Regulatory requirement status (Required/Recommended)
- Composite risk score = Impact * (1 + Difficulty) * Regulatory Multiplier

## Control Maturity Assessment
Maturity levels calculated per domain:
1. Initial (0-20%)
2. Managed (21-40%) 
3. Defined (41-60%)
4. Measured (61-80%)
5. Optimized (81-100%)

Implementation scoring factors:
- Documentation completeness
- Process formalization
- Control effectiveness testing
- Continuous monitoring
- Regular review cycles

## Risk Assessment Algorithms
Business impact calculations using:
- Data sensitivity classification (Public=1, Internal=2, Restricted=3, Critical=4)
- Process criticality rating (1-5)
- Regulatory exposure score (Local=1, National=2, International=3)
- Financial impact estimation

Risk Level = (Sensitivity + Criticality + Regulatory) * Implementation Gap

Key scoring patterns:
- All scores normalized to 0-100 scale
- Risk-weighted averages for domain aggregation
- Framework-specific minimum thresholds
- Compensating control adjustments
- Time-based degradation factors
