# compliance-scoring-algorithms

## Core Scoring Components

### Control Risk Assessment
`src/pages/tools-and-assessments/ComplianceGapAnalyzer.tsx`
- Domain-specific compliance scoring using weighted control priorities
- Maturity level calculation based on implementation rates per domain
- Risk scoring formula: `(controlPriority * statusWeight) / maxScore`
- Maps raw scores to business risk categories (High/Medium/Low)
Importance Score: 85

### Gap Analysis Engine  
`src/lib/compliance/scoreEngine.ts`
- Multi-framework compliance gap identification
- Framework-specific scoring matrices for NIST, ISO, GDPR
- Weighted domain calculations based on regulatory requirements
- Progressive maturity tracking across control domains
Importance Score: 92

### Urgency Scoring
`src/pages/tools-and-assessments/PoamGenerator.tsx`
- Remediation urgency calculation: `(riskLevel * timeWeight + impactScore) / maxUrgency`
- Priority adjustment based on regulatory deadlines
- Business impact weighting by control category
Importance Score: 75

## Assessment Logic

### Privacy Framework Scoring
`src/pages/tools-and-assessments/PrivacyAssessment.tsx`
- 5-function NIST privacy framework scoring
- Section-based evaluation with weighted calculations
- Progressive scoring based on control implementation status
Importance Score: 85

### Multi-Framework Analysis
`src/pages/tools-and-assessments/PrivacyGapAnalyzer.tsx`
- Cross-framework gap identification (GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, PIPEDA)
- Framework-specific scoring categories and thresholds
- Risk-based prioritization using custom weighting
Importance Score: 80

## Key Scoring Rules
- Minimum 50% section completion requirement
- Control scoring: Yes=2, Partial=1, No=0
- Domain maturity thresholds:
  - Level 1: <40%
  - Level 2: 40-70%
  - Level 3: 70-85%
  - Level 4: 85-95%
  - Level 5: >95%
