# assessment-workflow-engine

The assessment workflow engine implements sophisticated privacy and compliance assessment logic across multiple regulatory frameworks.

## Core Assessment Components

### Compliance Gap Analysis Engine
`src/pages/tools-and-assessments/ComplianceGapAnalyzer.tsx`

- Weighted control scoring system based on priority levels and implementation status
- Domain-specific maturity calculations using customized thresholds 
- Risk scoring algorithm incorporating control status and domain context
- Urgency scoring using priority/status matrices
- Compliance trend analysis with improvement rate tracking

### DPIA Generation System
`src/pages/tools-and-assessments/DpiaGenerator.tsx`

- Automated risk threshold determination
- Processing activity categorization engine
- Privacy risk scoring matrix implementation
- GDPR Article 35 compliance validation rules
- Impact level calculations based on data types and processing purposes

### Privacy Assessment Framework
`src/pages/tools-and-assessments/PrivacyAssessment.tsx`

- NIST Privacy Framework evaluation across 5 core functions
- Section-specific scoring algorithms with custom weighting
- Minimum 50% section completion validation
- Cross-framework control mapping capabilities

### Privacy Gap Analysis
`src/pages/tools-and-assessments/PrivacyGapAnalyzer.tsx`

- Multi-framework compliance gap identification
- Framework-specific risk scoring
- Automated compliance recommendations
- Regulatory requirement mapping across frameworks

## Key Business Rules

1. Assessment Scoring
- Critical controls weighted more heavily than low-priority ones
- Maturity levels require minimum thresholds across domains
- Risk calculations factor both implementation status and priority

2. Framework Validation
- Section completion requirements vary by framework
- Control mapping rules between different standards
- Evidence requirements based on control criticality

3. Recommendation Generation
- Priority classification based on risk levels
- Effort estimation for remediation activities
- Implementation timeframe calculations

4. DPIA Requirements
- Automated threshold evaluation for DPIA necessity
- Risk-based processing activity categorization
- Impact level determination rules

Importance Score: 85/100
