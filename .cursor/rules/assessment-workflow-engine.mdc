# assessment-workflow-engine

## Core Assessment Workflows

### Compliance Gap Analyzer
Location: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/ComplianceGapAnalyzer.tsx
Importance Score: 85

Implements specialized compliance gap analysis workflows:
- Domain-specific compliance scoring using weighted priority levels
- Control status evaluation with risk-based scoring algorithm
- Maturity level calculation based on implementation rates
- Custom urgency scoring for gap prioritization

### DPIA Generator
Location: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/DpiaGenerator.tsx
Importance Score: 70

Orchestrates Data Protection Impact Assessment workflows:
- Structured assessment progression with domain validation
- Risk level determination for data processing activities 
- GDPR requirement compliance status tracking

### Privacy Assessment Framework
Location: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/PrivacyAssessment.tsx
Importance Score: 85

Implements NIST Privacy Framework methodology:
- Custom scoring algorithm across 5 core privacy functions
- Section-based evaluation with weighted scoring
- Adaptive assessment flow based on completion status

## Assessment Business Rules

1. Control Scoring Logic
```typescript
calculateDomainScore(controls) {
  // Weighted scoring using control priority and status
  // Returns normalized domain compliance score
}
```

2. Risk Assessment Algorithm
```typescript
calculateRiskLevel(status, priority) {
  // Risk level based on implementation status and priority
  // Maps to business risk categories
}
```

3. Assessment Requirements
- Minimum 50% section completion for validity
- Weighted scoring system (Yes=2, Partial=1, No=0)
- 30-day regulatory compliance window
- Framework-specific control mappings

## Integration Points

Privacy Rights Management
Location: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/PrivacyRightsManager.tsx
Importance Score: 90

- GDPR-compliant data subject rights workflow
- Automated due date calculation
- Request prioritization system
- Multi-regulation rights management
