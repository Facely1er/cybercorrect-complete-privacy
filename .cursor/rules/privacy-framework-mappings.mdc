# privacy-framework-mappings

## Framework Correlation Engine
Location: src/pages/tools-and-assessments/PrivacyGapAnalyzer.tsx
Importance Score: 95/100

Maps and correlates controls across privacy frameworks:
- GDPR to CCPA mapping algorithm
- LGPD to GDPR control correlation
- PIPEDA requirement mapping
- Cross-framework gap identification
- Automated control mapping recommendations

Key mappings include:
```typescript
frameworkCorrelation: {
  gdpr: {
    ccpa: {
      'data-subject-rights': ['consumer-rights'],
      'lawful-basis': ['notice-choice'],
      'data-protection': ['security-measures']
    },
    lgpd: {
      'data-subject-rights': ['titular-rights'],
      'data-protection': ['security-standards']  
    }
  }
}
```

## Control Mapping Logic
Location: src/lib/compliance/mappingEngine.ts
Importance Score: 90/100

Implements sophisticated control mapping algorithms:
- Framework-specific control categorization 
- Control effectiveness scoring
- Gap identification across frameworks
- Requirement overlap detection
- Control hierarchy mapping

## Recommendation Generator
Location: src/lib/assessment/recommendationEngine.ts
Importance Score: 85/100

Generates automated recommendations based on:
- Framework-specific control requirements
- Cross-framework compliance gaps
- Organization maturity level
- Industry-specific requirements
- Implementation complexity scoring

## Framework Compatibility Analysis
Location: src/lib/compliance/compatibilityAnalyzer.ts
Importance Score: 80/100

Analyzes compatibility between frameworks:
- Control overlap detection
- Implementation conflict identification
- Framework-specific requirement validation
- Compliance scope determination
- Gap remediation prioritization
