# privacy-framework-mappings

## Framework Correlation Engine

Core mapping logic that correlates controls and requirements across major privacy frameworks:

1. Framework Control Mapping
- Bidirectional mapping between GDPR Articles ↔ CCPA Sections ↔ LGPD Chapters
- Control equivalency scoring based on requirement overlap
- Automated gap identification for framework-specific requirements
- Inheritance rules for shared control implementations

2. Cross-Framework Assessment Logic
```typescript
calculateFrameworkAlignment(source: Framework, target: Framework): number {
  // Weighted scoring of control mapping coverage
  // Control inheritance validation
  // Framework-specific requirement validation
}
```

3. Automated Recommendation Engine
- Control implementation suggestions based on framework correlations
- Priority scoring using framework-specific weighting
- Implementation effort estimation based on control complexity
- Resource requirement calculations per framework

## Key Framework Mappings

1. GDPR → CCPA
- Article 15 (Right of Access) → §1798.100 (Right to Know)
- Article 17 (Right to Erasure) → §1798.105 (Right to Delete) 
- Article 20 (Data Portability) → §1798.100(d) (Portability Requirements)

2. GDPR → LGPD
- Article 6 (Lawfulness) → Article 7 (Legal Bases)
- Article 37 (DPO) → Article 41 (DPO Requirements)
- Article 33 (Breach Notification) → Article 48 (Security Incident)

3. Control Implementation Requirements
- Documentation standards per framework
- Evidence collection requirements
- Validation criteria mapping
- Audit trail specifications

## Framework-Specific Logic

1. GDPR Processing Activities
- Legal basis validation
- Cross-border transfer requirements
- Special category data handling
- Representative requirements

2. CCPA Consumer Rights 
- Notice requirements
- Opt-out implementation
- Service provider obligations
- Financial incentive rules

3. LGPD Data Subject Rights
- Confirmation of processing
- Access requirements
- Correction procedures
- Anonymization rules

Importance Score: 85/100
