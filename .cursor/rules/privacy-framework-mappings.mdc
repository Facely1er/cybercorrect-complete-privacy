# privacy-framework-mappings

## Framework Correlation Engine
Importance Score: 95/100

Maps requirements and controls across major privacy frameworks:
- GDPR to CCPA/CPRA mapping
- LGPD correlation matrix 
- PIPEDA compliance mapping
- NIST Privacy Framework integration

Key mapping components:
- Control equivalency determination based on requirement scope
- Jurisdiction-specific obligation tracking
- Cross-framework gap analysis
- Automated control recommendations

## Privacy Assessment Logic
Importance Score: 90/100

Implements multi-framework assessment capabilities:
- Framework-specific question banks and scoring
- Control maturity calculations
- Risk-weighted gap analysis
- Automated remediation recommendations based on framework requirements

Domain-specific mapping logic includes:
- Data processing activity correlation
- Cross-border transfer requirements
- Data subject rights mapping
- Breach notification obligations

## Recommendation Generation
Importance Score: 85/100

Generates compliance recommendations through:
- Framework-specific control analysis
- Risk-based prioritization
- Implementation complexity scoring
- Resource requirement estimation

Recommendation engine considers:
- Organization size and type
- Data processing scope
- Geographic presence
- Industry-specific requirements

## Evidence Classification System 
Importance Score: 80/100

Manages compliance evidence across frameworks:
- Control-specific documentation requirements
- Cross-framework evidence mapping
- Documentation expiration tracking
- Automated renewal notifications
