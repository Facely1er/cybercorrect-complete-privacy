## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Privacy Compliance Platform

The platform implements automated privacy compliance management through interconnected assessment and workflow engines.

### Assessment Core
- Privacy Gap Analysis Engine calculates multi-framework compliance scores using NIST, GDPR, CCPA standards
- Risk scoring system applies weighted priority levels and implementation status
- Domain-specific maturity calculations based on control completion rates
- Custom urgency scoring for compliance gap prioritization

### Compliance Workflows
1. DPIA Generator
- Automated GDPR Article 35 risk threshold calculations
- Processing activity classification 
- Impact severity scoring by data category

2. Privacy Rights Management
- Multi-regulation request orchestration (GDPR/CCPA)
- 30-day compliance window tracking
- Automated request routing and SLA monitoring

3. Policy Generation System
- Multi-framework template selection
- Organization-specific clause generation
- Regulatory requirement mapping

### Risk Assessment Framework
- Privacy-specific scoring algorithm incorporating:
  - Control effectiveness weights
  - Framework-specific requirements
  - Industry risk factors
  - Gap severity classification

### Evidence Management
- Compliance documentation categorization
- Regulatory framework mapping
- Audit trail tracking
- Legal basis documentation

The system's core value derives from its comprehensive privacy compliance automation and sophisticated risk assessment algorithms tailored to privacy regulatory requirements.
