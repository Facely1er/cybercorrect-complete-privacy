<h2>4. Privacy-First Architecture and Data Handling</h2>
<p>ERMITS implements a Privacy-First Architecture across all products, built on the following principles:</p>
<h3>4.1 Client-Side Processing</h3>
<p>All core computational functions (assessments, SBOM analysis, risk scoring, compliance evaluations, privacy persona detection)
are performed locally within your browser or self-managed environment whenever technically feasible.</p>
<h3>4.2 Data Sovereignty Options</h3>
<p>You have multiple deployment and storage options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser-based local storage (IndexedDB, localStorage)</li>
<li>Desktop application with local file storage</li>
<li>Custom deployment options available for Enterprise (contact sales)</li>
<li>Self-managed cloud infrastructure (you control the environment)</li>
<li>ERMITS-managed cloud (Supabase or alternative providers)</li>
<li>Hybrid deployment (local processing with optional encrypted sync)</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.3 Data Residency</h3>
<p>For cloud-managed options, data residency is determined by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your selected deployment region</li>
<li>Applicable compliance requirements</li>
<li>Service infrastructure location (disclosed per product)</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.4 Zero-Knowledge Principles</h3>
<p>When using ERMITS-managed cloud services with encryption enabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data is encrypted client-side using AES-256-GCM via WebCrypto</li>
<li>Encryption keys are derived from your credentials and never transmitted to ERMITS</li>
<li>ERMITS administrators cannot decrypt your data</li>
<li>You are solely responsible for maintaining access to your encryption keys</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.5 Data Minimization</h3>
<p>ERMITS collects only the minimum data necessary for service functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Never Collected:</strong> Raw SBOM files, assessment content, CUI, FCI, proprietary business data, or detailed vulnerability findings remain under your exclusive control</li>
<li><strong>Optionally Collected:</strong> Account information (name, email, company) for authentication and billing</li>
<li><strong>Pseudonymized Telemetry:</strong> Anonymous performance metrics using irreversible cryptographic hashing (opt-in or opt-out based on product)</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.6 Product-Specific Privacy-First Implementations</h3>
<ul>
<li>STEEL assessment responses processed client-side with optional encrypted cloud storage</li>
<li>Advisory service engagements handled via secure client portals</li>
<li>Digital products delivered as downloadable files or web-based tools with local processing</li>
<li>No access to proprietary strategic information by ERMITS</li>
<li>AI persona detection performed 100% client-side using JavaScript in user's browser</li>
<li>No persona data or assessment responses transmitted to ERMITS servers</li>
<li>Privacy Exposure Index calculated from publicly available service information only</li>
<li>User assessment data stored in browser localStorage (user-controlled)</li>
<li>Optional cloud sync available with end-to-end encryption</li>
</ul>
